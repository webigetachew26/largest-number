## Algorithm 
1. Initialize a variable `largest` with the first element of the 
array. 
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element. 
3. Compare each element with `largest`. 
4. If the current element is greater than `largest`, update 
`largest` with the current element. 
5. After the loop ends, `largest` will contain the largest 
number in the array.
